# Automated Instagram Bot

**A python-based automated bot that can get the list of a user's followers and following, and can also display the list of persons who don't follow back the user.**

**Uses Selenium and Chromedriver to automatically interact with the browser.**

**Quick Note:** 
*Sometimes, the code might not work as expected. In such cases, find out the point where the code stops working and check the absolute X-Path of elements from the corresponding Instagram Page.*

(Over the course of time, there can be some minor changes in the code, as a result of which the absolute X-Path also gets changed.)
